<!-- This template may feel a bit too structured, so feel free to change the sections if they do not fit your style. I think that these questions are useful to think about though!

Also the answer suggestions may feel a bit robotic, so definitely replace them with nice sentences.

Don't forget to be respectful, and to give enough details for others to pitch in or give advice. Don't fret if you can't figure all of these out though, we'll discover these together!

**What the rule should do:**


**What problems does it solve:**


**Example of things the rule would report:**

```elm
<some code>
--> <suggested fix>
```

**Example of things the rule would not report:**

```elm
<some code>
```


**Should this be part of the Simplify rule or should it be a new rule?**

<!-- The idea so far is to have everything in one rule, but maybe in this case a new rule would be more appropriate.
If you think it should be a new rule, please write about when you think users should (and should not) enable the rule.

**I am looking for:**

<!--
- Feedback
- Tips and help on how to implement it
- Someone to implement it with/for me
-->





<!-- Thanks for writing all these helpful details. These are all useful details that you can use in the rule's documentation when you go implementing it, so this was definitely worth your investment.
